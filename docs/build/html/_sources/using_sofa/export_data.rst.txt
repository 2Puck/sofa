Export Data
===========

Once a subgroup has been defined and the selected curves have been averaged the analysis cycle of SOFA has been completed. Before selecting another subset of curves or analyzing the next FSD the results have to be exported.

.. note::

   As of version 1.0 SOFA has no capacities to remember previous selected subsets of Force Curves or previous averaged curves. Results have to be exported to be stored.

Please use **export**, which can be found within the control frame of SOFAâ€™s GUI, to store your results. You will be asked for the path and name of the subfolder in which the results are stored. Data can be exported in different formats: sofa, tex, txt, hdf5 and excel. Complete by **Export data**.

**Foldername** is supposed to be a comprehensive name of the experiment. SOFA will create a numbered subfolder (session#) in which all output data is stored, including images of all stacked plots.

Data is saved and you can continue with SOFA after this message appears.
